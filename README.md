Travella is the first Web Development project I have come up with during my first year of studies. I tried to implement some Front-End Skills such as: 
- The use of HTML & CSS Features to build the website's core.
- Some JavaScript Event Listeners.
- Modal Windows.
- Multi-Form Data Submission & Storage as a JSON Data.
